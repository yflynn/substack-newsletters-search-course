## 🎯 Why Take This Course?

Unlike basic tutorials, this course provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building a complete end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using modern tools and best practices. You’ll see how to:

- Automate data pipelines for ingesting and processing newsletter content
- Integrate multiple cloud and open-source services (Supabase, Qdrant, Prefect, FastAPI)
- Build a robust backend for keyword and LLM-powered search
- Deploy and interact with your system using Google Cloud, a Gradio UI and REST API

All with 4 detailed articles and a video!

## 👥 Who Is This Course For?

| Audience              | Why Join?                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ML/AI Engineers       | Build scalable RAG and LLM-powered search systems     |
| Software Engineers    | Learn modern backend, API, and cloud deployment skills|
| Data Engineers        | Automate data pipelines and vector search workflows   |
| AI Enthusiasts        | Get hands-on with real-world, production-grade tools  |

## 🧑‍🎓 What You Will Learn

By the end of this course, you will have a fully functional RAG system and the skills to build production-ready applications to search over your favorite newsletters. You will:

- Ingest articles from RSS feeds and store them in Supabase
- Generate and index embeddings in Qdrant, including payload indexes for filtering with optimized index configuration with quantization and hybrid search
- Orchestrate and schedule workflows with Prefect (local and cloud)
- Build and expose RESTful search endpoints using FastAPI
- Integrate multiple LLM providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- Deploy your backend to Google Cloud Run for global access
- Create an interactive Gradio UI for end-users

## 🎓 Prerequisites

- Python (Intermediate)
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Familiarity with AI/LLM concepts is helpful
- Modern laptop/PC (no GPU required; free tiers are sufficient)

## 💵 Does this course cost anything?

- No, this course is completely free to access and learn from. Starring and sharing the repository is appreciated!
- Google Cloud Run monthly free tier is sufficient for deployment
- Prefect cloud monthly free tier is sufficient for orchestration once your flow is deployed but it is recommended to use prefect local server for development as it is unlimited.
- Supabase and Qdrant monthly free tiers are sufficient for hosting the Postgres and vector databases
- OpenRouter daily requests on free LLM models is sufficient for LLM calls but you can also use OpenAI or Hugging Face as backup LLM providers as the project supports multiple LLM providers.
- Any other tools used in this course like FastAPI, Docker, Gradio, or Opik are completely free to use.
